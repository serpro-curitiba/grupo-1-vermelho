## What is Specky?

Specky is a **complete Spec-Driven Development plugin** — 13 specialized agents, 57 MCP tools, 22 prompts, 8 skills, and 14 automation hooks — that enforces a deterministic 10-phase pipeline from **any input** (meeting transcripts, documents, Figma designs, or natural language prompts) through specifications, architecture, infrastructure as code, implementation, and deployment.

The plugin is powered by the [specky-sdd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/specky-sdd) MCP engine and the [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/paulasilvatech/spec-kit) methodology. Install Specky and you get **everything**: the agents orchestrate the pipeline, the tools enforce validation, the hooks guard every phase transition, and the skills provide domain knowledge.


## What is a Plugin?

A plugin is a **complete AI development package** — not just a tool server. It bundles everything your AI IDE needs into a single installable unit:

| Primitive | What it is | Specky includes |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Agents** | Specialized AI personas with defined roles, tools, and guardrails | 13 agents — @specky-orchestrator (full pipeline), @specky-onboarding (wizard), @spec-engineer, @design-architect, @task-planner, @quality-reviewer, and 7 more |
| **Prompts** | Slash commands that activate the right agent for a task | 22 prompts — `/specky-greenfield`, `/specky-specify`, `/specky-release`, `/specky-orchestrate`, etc. |
| **Skills** | Domain knowledge files loaded into agent context automatically | 8 skills — SDD pipeline rules, EARS patterns, implementation patterns, test criteria, release gate protocol |
| **Hooks** | Scripts that run before/after every tool call for validation | 16 hooks — artifact-validator, branch-validator, phase-gate, lgtm-gate, security-scan, etc. |
| **MCP Server** | The tool engine that validates, generates, and enforces | 57 tools via Model Context Protocol (the runtime underneath) |

### Why not just an MCP server?

An MCP server gives you **tools**. A plugin gives you the **experience**:

- **Tools alone**: You call `sdd_write_spec` and hope you're in the right phase, with the right prerequisites, on the right branch.
- **Plugin**: You type `@specky-orchestrator` and the agent validates your phase, checks your branch, loads the right skill, calls the right tool, runs pre/post hooks, and pauses for LGTM before advancing.

The MCP engine is the runtime. The plugin is the product.

### How to install

Specky ships as a single npm package with a unified `specky` CLI. Works on macOS, Linux, Windows, and WSL.

```bash
# One-time global install — puts `specky` in your PATH
npm install -g specky-sdd@latest

# Bootstrap each project (from any directory)
cd your-project
specky install
```

Or per-project (for teams — pins version in `package.json`, run via `npx`):

```bash
cd your-project
npm install --save-dev specky-sdd@latest
npx specky install
```

Or zero-install (one command, no persistent install):

```bash
cd your-project
npx -y specky-sdd@latest install
```

The CLI auto-detects whether you use Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or both, and installs the 13 agents, 22 prompts, 8 skills, 16 hooks, the MCP server registration (`.mcp.json` + `.vscode/mcp.json`), and **pre-authorizes all required tools** (`permissions.allow` in Claude settings, `chat.mcp.enabled` in VS Code). Run `specky doctor` anytime to validate integrity and config.

**Alternate channels** (same package, same layout):

```bash
# Claude Code native plugin
/plugin marketplace add paulasilvatech/specky
/plugin install specky@paulasilvatech

# Microsoft APM (for teams already using APM)
apm install paulasilvatech/specky
```

## Why Specifications Matter in the AI Era

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/why-specifications-matter.svg" alt="Why Specifications Matter, From Vibe Coding to Deterministic Development" width="100%"/>
</p>

### The Problem: Vibe Coding

AI coding assistants are fast but chaotic. You say *"build me a login system"* and the AI generates code immediately, skipping requirements, guessing architecture, and producing something that works but doesn't match what anyone actually needed. This is **vibe coding**: generating code based on vibes instead of validated specifications.

The result? Teams spend 40% of their time on rework because requirements were never written down, acceptance criteria were never defined, and there's no way to verify the code matches the original intent.

### The Solution: Deterministic Development

**Specifications** are structured documents that describe *what the system must do* before anyone writes code. They've existed for decades in engineering, but AI development mostly ignores them. Specky brings them back, with AI enforcement.

**Key concepts you should know:**

| Concept | What it is | Why it matters |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Markdown** | The universal language that both humans and AI read fluently | All spec artifacts are `.md` files in your repo, versioned with Git |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol — an open standard that lets AI assistants call external tools | Specky is an MCP server; any AI IDE can connect to it |
| **EARS Notation** | A method for writing requirements that forces precision with 6 patterns | Eliminates vague statements like "the system should be fast" |
| **Agents and Skills** | Specialized AI roles that invoke Specky tools with domain expertise | 13 agents + 8 skills orchestrate the full pipeline |
| **Plugins** | A complete AI development package: agents + prompts + skills + hooks + MCP server | Installed via [APM](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/) — Microsoft's dependency manager for AI agents |

### How Specky Enforces Determinism

Specky adds a **deterministic engine** between your intent and your code:

- **State Machine**: 10 mandatory phases, no skipping. Init, Discover, Specify, Clarify, Design, Tasks, Analyze, Implement, Verify, Release.
- **EARS Validator**: Every requirement validated against 6 patterns. No vague statements pass.
- **Cross-Artifact Analysis**: Automatic alignment checking between spec, design, and tasks. Orphaned requirements are flagged instantly.
- **MCP-to-MCP Architecture**: Specky outputs structured JSON that your AI client routes to GitHub, Azure DevOps, Jira, Terraform, Figma, and Docker MCP servers. No vendor lock-in.

> **The AI is the operator; Specky is the engine.** The AI's creativity is channeled through a validated pipeline instead of producing unstructured guesswork. For a complete educational walkthrough, see [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md).

| Cross-artifact traceability | Requirement to design to task to test to code |
| Gitflow-SDD branching | spec/NNN → develop → stage → main |
| Unified CLI distribution | `npm install -g specky-sdd && specky install` — one binary, multi-OS (macOS/Linux/Windows/WSL) |
| Works in any MCP host | VS Code + Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP client |
| Zero outbound network calls | Fully air-gapped, code never leaves your machine |
| MIT open source | Fork it, extend it, audit it. No vendor lock, no seat pricing |


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/) (Node 20 LTS recommended)
- **An AI IDE**: VS Code with Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf

### Install the Plugin

**One-time CLI install:**

```bash
npm install -g specky-sdd@latest
```

**Bootstrap each project:**

```bash
cd your-project
specky install
```

That's it. The CLI auto-detects Claude Code and/or GitHub Copilot and installs the 13 agents, 22 prompts, 8 skills, 16 hooks, the MCP server registration, and pre-authorizes all required tools.

**Other install modes:**

```bash
# Per-project (teams — pins version in package.json)
cd your-project
npm install --save-dev specky-sdd@latest
npx specky install

# Zero-install (one command, no persistent CLI)
cd your-project
npx -y specky-sdd@latest install
```

Full per-OS walkthrough: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) · CLI reference: [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

### Verify

```bash
specky doctor          # validates integrity + configuration
specky status          # shows active features and pipeline phase
```

Then open your IDE and type:

```
@specky-onboarding
```

The onboarding wizard detects your project context (greenfield/brownfield/modernization) and guides you through setup.

### Try It Now

```
@specky-orchestrator run the pipeline for a todo API
```

The orchestrator coordinates all 10 phases: Init → Research → Specify → Design → Tasks → Implement → Verify → Review → Release, with LGTM gates at Specify, Design, and Tasks.

| Your situation | Guide |
|---------------|-------|
| Building something new | [Greenfield](#greenfield-project-start-from-scratch) |
| Adding features to existing code | [Brownfield](#brownfield-project-add-features-to-existing-code) |
| Upgrading a legacy system | [Modernization](#modernization-project-assess-and-upgrade-legacy-systems) |

> **Tip:** **New to Spec-Driven Development?** Specky already includes all the SDD methodology from [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/paulasilvatech/spec-kit). Just install Specky and the pipeline guides you through every phase with [educative outputs](#educative-outputs) that explain the concepts as you work.


## Where Specifications Live

Every feature gets its own numbered directory inside `.specs/`. This keeps specifications, design documents, and quality reports together as a self-contained package.

```
your-project/
├── src/                          ← Your application code
├── .specs/                       ← All Specky specifications
│   ├── 001-user-authentication/  ← Feature #1
│   │   ├── CONSTITUTION.md       ← Project principles and governance
│   │   ├── SPECIFICATION.md      ← EARS requirements with acceptance criteria
│   │   ├── DESIGN.md             ← Architecture, data model, API contracts
│   │   ├── RESEARCH.md           ← Resolved unknowns and technical decisions
│   │   ├── TASKS.md              ← Implementation breakdown with dependencies
│   │   ├── ANALYSIS.md           ← Quality gate report
│   │   ├── CHECKLIST.md          ← Domain-specific quality checklist
│   │   ├── CROSS_ANALYSIS.md     ← Spec-design-tasks alignment score
│   │   ├── COMPLIANCE.md         ← Regulatory framework validation
│   │   ├── VERIFICATION.md       ← Drift and phantom task detection
│   │   └── .sdd-state.json       ← Pipeline state (current phase, history)
│   ├── 002-payment-gateway/      ← Feature #2
│   └── 003-notification-system/  ← Feature #3
├── reports/                      ← Cross-feature analysis reports
└── .specky/config.yml            ← Optional project-level configuration
```

**Naming convention:** `NNN-feature-name`, zero-padded number + kebab-case name. Each directory is independent; you can work on multiple features simultaneously.


## Input Methods: 6 Ways to Start

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/input-methods.svg" alt="Specky 6 Input Methods" width="100%"/>
</p>

Specky accepts multiple input types. Choose the one that matches your starting point:

### 1. Natural Language Prompt (simplest)

Type your idea directly into the AI chat. No files needed.

```
> I need a feature for user authentication with email/password login,
  password reset via email, and JWT session management
```

The AI calls `sdd_init` + `sdd_discover` to structure your idea into a spec project.

**Best for:** Quick prototyping, brainstorming, greenfield projects.

### 2. Meeting Transcript (VTT / SRT / TXT / MD)

Import a transcript from Teams, Zoom, or Google Meet. Specky extracts topics, decisions, action items, and requirements automatically.

```
> Import the requirements meeting transcript and create a specification
```

The AI calls `sdd_import_transcript` → extracts:
- Participants and speakers
- Topics discussed with summaries
- Decisions made
- Action items
- Raw requirement statements
- Constraints mentioned
- Open questions

**Supported formats:** `.vtt` (WebVTT), `.srt` (SubRip), `.txt`, `.md`

**Pro tip:** Use `sdd_auto_pipeline` to go from transcript to complete spec in one step:

```
> Run the auto pipeline from this meeting transcript: /path/to/meeting.vtt
```

**Got multiple transcripts?** Use batch processing:

```
> Batch import all transcripts from the meetings/ folder
```

The AI calls `sdd_batch_transcripts` → processes every `.vtt`, `.srt`, `.txt`, and `.md` file in the folder.

### 3. Existing Documents (PDF / DOCX / PPTX)

Import requirements documents, RFPs, architecture decks, or any existing documentation.

```
> Import this requirements document and create a specification:
  /path/to/requirements.pdf
```

The AI calls `sdd_import_document` → converts to Markdown, extracts sections, and feeds into the spec pipeline.

**Supported formats:** `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.txt`, `.md`

**Batch import from a folder:**

```
> Import all documents from the docs/ folder into specs
```

The AI calls `sdd_batch_import` → processes every supported file in the directory.

> **Tip:** For best results with PDF/DOCX, install the optional `mammoth` and `pdfjs-dist` packages for enhanced formatting, table extraction, and image handling.

### 4. Figma Design (design-to-spec)

Convert Figma designs into requirements specifications. Works with the Figma MCP server.

```
> Convert this Figma design into a specification:
  https://figma.com/design/abc123/my-app
```

The AI calls `sdd_figma_to_spec` → extracts components, layouts, and interactions, then routes to the Figma MCP server for design context.

**Best for:** Design-first workflows, UI-driven projects.

### 5. Codebase Scan (brownfield / modernization)

Scan an existing codebase to detect tech stack, frameworks, structure, and patterns before writing specs.

```
> Scan this codebase and tell me what we're working with
```

The AI calls `sdd_scan_codebase` → detects:

| Detected | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Language | TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java |
| Framework | Next.js, Express, React, Django, FastAPI, Gin |
| Package Manager | npm, pip, poetry, cargo, maven, gradle |
| Runtime | Node.js, Python, Go, JVM |
| Directory Tree | Full project structure with file counts |

**Best for:** Understanding an existing project before adding features or modernizing.

### 6. Raw Text (paste anything)

No file? Just paste the content directly. Every import tool accepts a `raw_text` parameter as an alternative to a file path.

```
> Here's the raw requirements from the client email:

  The system needs to handle 10,000 concurrent users...
  Authentication must support SSO via Azure AD...
  All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit...

  Import this and create a specification.
```


## Three Project Types, One Pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/project-workflows.svg" alt="Greenfield, Brownfield, and Modernization Workflows" width="100%"/>
</p>

Specky adapts to any project type. The pipeline is the same; the **starting point** is what changes.


## Greenfield Project: Start from Scratch

**Scenario:** You're building a new application with no existing code.

### Step 1: Initialize and discover

```
> I'm building a task management API. Initialize a Specky project and help
  me define the scope.
```

The AI calls `sdd_init` → creates `.specs/001-task-management/CONSTITUTION.md`
Then calls `sdd_discover` → asks you **7 structured questions**:

1. **Scope**: What problem does this solve? What are the boundaries of v1?
2. **Users**: Who are the primary users? What are their skill levels?
3. **Constraints**: Language, framework, hosting, budget, timeline?
4. **Integrations**: What external systems, APIs, or services?
5. **Performance**: Expected load, concurrent users, response times?
6. **Security**: Authentication, authorization, compliance requirements?
7. **Deployment**: CI/CD, monitoring, rollback strategy?

Answer each question. Your answers feed directly into the specification.

### Step 2: Write the specification

```
> Write the specification based on my discovery answers
```

The AI calls `sdd_write_spec` → creates `SPECIFICATION.md` with EARS requirements:

```markdown
## Requirements

REQ-001 [Ubiquitous]: The system shall provide a REST API for task CRUD operations.

REQ-002 [Event-driven]: When a user creates a task, the system shall assign
a unique identifier and return it in the response.

REQ-003 [State-driven]: While a task is in "in-progress" state, the system
shall prevent deletion without explicit force confirmation.

REQ-004 [Unwanted]: If the API receives a malformed request body, then the
system shall return a 400 status with a descriptive error message.
```

**The AI pauses here.** Review `.specs/001-task-management/SPECIFICATION.md` and reply **LGTM** when satisfied.

### Step 3: Design the architecture

```
> LGTM.proceed to design
```

The AI calls `sdd_write_design` → creates `DESIGN.md` with:
- System architecture diagram (Mermaid)
- Data model / ER diagram
- API contracts with endpoints, request/response schemas
- Sequence diagrams for key flows
- Technology decisions with rationale

Review and reply **LGTM**.

### Step 4: Break into tasks

```
> LGTM.create the task breakdown
```

The AI calls `sdd_write_tasks` → creates `TASKS.md` with implementation tasks mapped to acceptance criteria, dependencies, and estimated complexity.

### Step 5: Quality gates

```
> Run analysis, compliance check for SOC2, and generate all diagrams
```

The AI calls:
- `sdd_run_analysis` → completeness audit, orphaned criteria detection
- `sdd_compliance_check` → SOC2 controls validation
- `sdd_generate_all_diagrams` → architecture, sequence, ER, flow, dependency, traceability diagrams

### Step 6: Generate infrastructure and tests

```
> Generate Terraform for Azure, a Dockerfile, and test stubs for vitest
```

The AI calls:
- `sdd_generate_iac` → Terraform configuration
- `sdd_generate_dockerfile` → Dockerfile + docker-compose
- `sdd_generate_tests` → Test stubs with acceptance criteria mapped to test cases

### Step 7: Export and ship

```
> Export tasks to GitHub Issues and create a PR
```

The AI calls `sdd_export_work_items` + `sdd_create_pr` → generates work item payloads and PR body with full spec traceability.

> **Next:** **Next:** Learn about [EARS notation](#ears-notation) to understand the requirement patterns, or see [All 57 Tools](#all-57-tools) for a complete reference.


## Brownfield Project: Add Features to Existing Code

**Scenario:** You have a running application and need to add a new feature with proper specifications.

### Step 1: Scan the codebase first

```
> Scan this codebase so Specky understands what we're working with
```

The AI calls `sdd_scan_codebase` → detects tech stack, framework, directory structure. This context informs all subsequent tools.

```
Detected: TypeScript + Next.js + npm + Node.js
Files: 247 across 32 directories
```

### Step 2: Initialize with codebase context

```
> Initialize a feature for adding real-time notifications to this Next.js app.
  Use the codebase scan results as context.
```

The AI calls `sdd_init` → creates `.specs/001-real-time-notifications/CONSTITUTION.md`
Then calls `sdd_discover` with the codebase summary → the 7 discovery questions now include context about your existing tech stack:

> *"What technical constraints exist? **Note: This project already uses TypeScript, Next.js, npm, Node.js.** Consider compatibility with the existing stack."*

### Step 3: Import existing documentation

If you have existing PRDs, architecture docs, or meeting notes:

```
> Import the PRD for notifications: /docs/notifications-prd.pdf
```

The AI calls `sdd_import_document` → converts to Markdown and adds to the spec directory. The content is used as input when writing the specification.

### Step 4: Write spec with codebase awareness

```
> Write the specification for real-time notifications. Consider the existing
  Next.js architecture and any patterns already in the codebase.
```

The specification references existing components, APIs, and patterns from the codebase scan.

### Step 5: Check for drift

After implementation, verify specs match the code:

```
> Check if the implementation matches the specification
```

The AI calls `sdd_check_sync` → generates a drift report flagging any divergence between spec and code.

### Step 6: Cross-feature analysis

If you have multiple features specified:

```
> Run cross-analysis across all features to find conflicts
```

The AI calls `sdd_cross_analyze` → checks for contradictions, shared dependencies, and consistency issues across `.specs/001-*`, `.specs/002-*`, etc.

> **Next:** **Next:** See [compliance frameworks](#compliance-frameworks) for regulatory validation, or [MCP integration](#mcp-integration-architecture) for routing to external tools.


## Modernization Project: Assess and Upgrade Legacy Systems

**Scenario:** You have a legacy system that needs assessment, documentation, and incremental modernization.

### Step 1: Scan and document the current state

```
> Scan this legacy codebase and help me understand what we have
```

The AI calls `sdd_scan_codebase` → maps the technology stack, directory tree, and file counts.

### Step 2: Import all existing documentation

Gather everything you have.architecture documents, runbooks, meeting notes about the system:

```
> Batch import all documents from /docs/legacy-system/ into specs
```

The AI calls `sdd_batch_import` → processes PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, and text files. Each becomes a Markdown reference in the spec directory.

### Step 3: Import stakeholder meetings

If you have recorded meetings with stakeholders discussing the modernization:

```
> Batch import all meeting transcripts from /recordings/
```

The AI calls `sdd_batch_transcripts` → extracts decisions, requirements, constraints, and open questions from every transcript.

### Step 4: Create the modernization specification

```
> Write a specification for modernizing the authentication module.
  Consider the legacy constraints from the imported documents and
  meeting transcripts.
```

The specification accounts for:
- Current system behavior (from codebase scan)
- Existing documentation (from imported docs)
- Stakeholder decisions (from meeting transcripts)
- Migration constraints and backward compatibility

### Step 5: Compliance assessment

Legacy systems often need compliance validation during modernization:

```
> Run compliance checks against HIPAA and SOC2 for the modernized auth module
```

The AI calls `sdd_compliance_check` → validates the specification against regulatory controls and flags gaps.

### Step 6: Generate migration artifacts

```
> Generate the implementation plan, Terraform for the new infrastructure,
  and a runbook for the migration
```

The AI calls:
- `sdd_implement` → phased implementation plan with checkpoints
- `sdd_generate_iac` → infrastructure configuration for the target environment
- `sdd_generate_runbook` → operational runbook with rollback procedures

### Step 7: Generate onboarding for the team

```
> Generate an onboarding guide for developers joining the modernization project
```

The AI calls `sdd_generate_onboarding` → creates a guide covering architecture decisions, codebase navigation, development workflow, and testing strategy.

## Pipeline and LGTM Gates

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/pipeline-lgtm-gates.svg" alt="Pipeline with LGTM Quality Gates" width="100%"/>
</p>

Every Specky project follows the same 10-phase pipeline. The state machine **blocks phase-skipping**. You cannot jump from Init to Design without completing Specify first.

**LGTM gates:** After each major phase (Specify, Design, Tasks), the AI pauses and asks you to review. Reply **LGTM** to proceed. This ensures human oversight at every quality gate.

**Feedback loop:** If `sdd_verify_tasks` detects drift between specification and implementation, Specky routes you back to the Specify phase to correct the divergence before proceeding.

**Advancing phases:** If you need to manually advance:

```
> Advance to the next phase
```

The AI calls `sdd_advance_phase` → moves the pipeline forward if all prerequisites are met.

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/pipeline-10-phases.svg" alt="Specky 10-Phase Pipeline" width="100%"/>
</p>

## The Spec-Driven Development Platform

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/specky-speckit-integration.svg" alt="How Spec-Kit and Specky Work Together in the GitHub + Microsoft Ecosystem" width="100%"/>
</p>

### How Spec-Kit and Specky Complement Each Other

**[Spec-Kit](https://github.com/paulasilvatech/spec-kit)** is the open-source SDD methodology: EARS notation, gated pipeline phases, constitution model, 25+ specialized agents, and Markdown prompt templates. It defines **what** to do.

**Specky** is the complete plugin that reimplements that methodology as 57 enforceable MCP tools with 13 agents, 22 prompts, 8 skills, and 16 hooks. It enforces **how** to do it.

| | Spec-Kit (Methodology) | Specky (Plugin) |
|--|------------------------|-----------------|
| **What it is** | Prompt templates + agent definitions | Complete plugin: 13 agents + 57 MCP tools + 22 prompts + 8 skills + 16 hooks |
| **How it works** | AI reads `.md` templates and follows instructions | AI calls agents that orchestrate tools with hook validation |
| **Validation** | AI tries to follow the prompts | State machine, EARS regex, Zod schemas, pre/post hooks |
| **Install** | Copy `.github/agents/` and `.claude/commands/` | `npm install -g specky-sdd && specky install` |
| **Works standalone** | Yes, in any AI IDE | Yes, includes all Spec-Kit patterns |
| **Best for** | Learning SDD, lightweight adoption | Production enforcement, enterprise, compliance |

### Together: The Complete SDD Layer

When you install Specky, you get the full Spec-Kit methodology reimplemented as validated MCP tools. **No separate installation of Spec-Kit needed.** But Spec-Kit remains available as a standalone learning tool for teams that want to adopt SDD concepts before using the engine.

Together they form the **SDD layer** of the GitHub + Microsoft enterprise platform. Specky reimplements the Spec-Kit methodology as enforceable MCP tools with compliance, traceability, and automation built in.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "specky": {
      "command": "specky-sdd"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** This example assumes Specky is installed via `specky install` (after `npm install -g specky-sdd@latest`). See [Install the Plugin](#install-the-plugin) for details.

## Project Configuration

Create `.specky/config.yml` in your project root to customize Specky:

```yaml
# .specky/config.yml
templates_path: ./my-templates       # Override built-in templates
default_framework: vitest            # Default test framework
compliance_frameworks: [hipaa, soc2] # Frameworks to check
audit_enabled: true                  # Enable audit trail
```

When `templates_path` is set, Specky uses your custom templates instead of the built-in ones. When `audit_enabled` is true, tool invocations are logged locally.


## MCP Integration Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/architecture-mcp-ecosystem.svg" alt="Specky MCP Ecosystem Architecture" width="100%"/>
</p>

Specky outputs structured JSON with routing instructions. Your AI client calls the appropriate external MCP server:

```
Specky --> sdd_export_work_items(platform: "azure_boards") --> JSON payload
  --> AI Client --> Azure DevOps MCP --> create_work_item()

Specky --> sdd_validate_iac(provider: "terraform") --> validation payload
  --> AI Client --> Terraform MCP --> plan/validate

Specky --> sdd_figma_to_spec(file_key: "abc123") --> Figma request
  --> AI Client --> Figma MCP --> get_design_context()
```

### Supported External MCP Servers

| MCP Server | Integration |
|-----------|-------------|
| **GitHub MCP** | Issues, PRs, Codespaces |
| **Azure DevOps MCP** | Work Items, Boards |
| **Jira MCP** | Issues, Projects |
| **Terraform MCP** | Plan, Validate, Apply |
| **Azure MCP** | Template validation |
| **Figma MCP** | Design context, FigJam diagrams |
| **Docker MCP** | Local dev environments |


## EARS Notation

Every requirement in Specky follows EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax):

| Pattern | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Ubiquitous | The system shall... | The system shall encrypt all data at rest |
| Event-driven | When [event], the system shall... | When a user submits login, the system shall validate credentials |
| State-driven | While [state], the system shall... | While offline, the system shall queue requests |
| Optional | Where [condition], the system shall... | Where 2FA is enabled, the system shall require OTP |
| Unwanted | If [condition], then the system shall... | If session expires, the system shall redirect to login |
| Complex | While [state], when [event]... | While in maintenance, when request arrives, queue it |

The EARS validator programmatically checks every requirement against these 6 patterns. Vague terms like "fast", "good", "easy" are flagged automatically.


## Compliance Frameworks

Built-in compliance checking against:

- **HIPAA**: Access control, audit, encryption, PHI protection
- **SOC 2**: Logical access, monitoring, change management, incident response
- **GDPR**: Lawful processing, right to erasure, data portability, breach notification
- **PCI-DSS**: Firewall, stored data protection, encryption, user identification
- **ISO 27001**: Security policies, access control, cryptography, incident management


## Educative Outputs

Every tool response includes structured guidance:

```json
{
  "explanation": "What was done and why",
  "next_steps": "Guided next action with command suggestion",
  "learning_note": "Educational context about the concept",
  "diagram": "Mermaid diagram relevant to the output"
}
```


## Complete Pipeline Flow

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/end-to-end-flow.svg" alt="Specky Complete Pipeline Development Flow" width="100%"/>
</p>

From any [input](#input-methods-6-ways-to-start) to production -- fully automated, [MCP-orchestrated](#mcp-integration-architecture), with artifacts and diagrams generated at every step. All artifacts are saved in [`.specs/NNN-feature/`](#where-specifications-live).


## Enterprise Ready

Specky is built with enterprise adoption in mind.

### Security Posture

- **2 runtime dependencies** — minimal attack surface (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `zod`)
- **Zero outbound network requests** — all data stays local
- **No `eval()` or dynamic code execution** — template rendering is string replacement only
- **Path traversal prevention**: FileManager sanitizes all paths, blocks `..` sequences
- **Zod `.strict()` validation** — every tool input is schema-validated; unknown fields rejected
- **security-scan hook** blocks commits containing hardcoded secrets (exit code 2)
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full OWASP Top 10 coverage
- See [docs/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md](docs/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md) for complete security architecture

### Security Best Practices

When using Specky, follow these practices to protect your data:

| Practice | Why | How |
|----------|-----|-----|
| **Use stdio mode for local development** | No network exposure | `npx specky-sdd` (default) |
| **Never expose HTTP mode to public networks** | HTTP is unencrypted, no auth | If using `--http`, bind to localhost only. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) with TLS and authentication for remote access |
| **Protect the `.specs/` directory** | Contains your specification artifacts (architecture, API contracts, business logic) | Add `.specs/` to `.gitignore` if specs contain sensitive IP, or use a private repo |
| **Protect checkpoints** | `.specs/{feature}/.checkpoints/` stores full artifact snapshots | Same as above — treat checkpoints like source code |
| **Review auto-generated specs before committing** | Turnkey and auto-pipeline generate from natural language — may capture sensitive details | Review SPECIFICATION.md and DESIGN.md before `git add` |
| **Keep the security-scan hook enabled** | Detects API keys, passwords, tokens in staged files | Comes pre-configured; don't disable `.claude/hooks/security-scan.sh` |
| **Use environment variables for secrets** | Specky never stores credentials, but your specs might reference them | Write `$DATABASE_URL` in specs, never the actual connection string |
| **Run `npm audit` regularly** | Catches dependency vulnerabilities | `npm audit` — CI runs this automatically on every PR |

### Data Sensitivity Guide

| What Specky creates | Contains | Sensitivity | Recommendation |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `CONSTITUTION.md` | Project scope, principles | Low | Safe to commit |
| `SPECIFICATION.md` | Requirements, acceptance criteria | Medium | Review before committing — may contain business logic details |
| `DESIGN.md` | Architecture, API contracts, security model | **High** | May contain infrastructure details, auth flows, data schemas |
| `TASKS.md` | Implementation plan, effort estimates | Low | Safe to commit |
| `ANALYSIS.md` | Quality gate results, coverage | Low | Safe to commit |
| `.sdd-state.json` | Pipeline phase timestamps | Low | Safe to commit |
| `.checkpoints/*.json` | **Full copies of all artifacts** | **High** | Protect like source code — contains everything above |
| `docs/journey-*.md` | Complete SDD audit trail with timestamps | Medium | Review before sharing externally |
| Routing payloads | Branch names, PR bodies, work items | **Transient** (memory only) | Never persisted by Specky; forwarded to external MCPs by the AI client |

> **Key principle:** Specky creates files **only on your local filesystem**. Nothing is sent to any cloud service unless **you** push to git or the AI client routes a payload to an external MCP server. You are always in control.

### Compliance Validation

Built-in compliance checking validates your specifications against industry frameworks:

| Framework | Controls | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| HIPAA | 6 controls | Healthcare applications |
| SOC 2 | 6 controls | SaaS and cloud services |
| GDPR | 6 controls | EU data processing |
| PCI-DSS | 6 controls | Payment card handling |
| ISO 27001 | 6 controls | Enterprise security management |

### Audit Trail

Every pipeline phase produces a traceable artifact in `.specs/NNN-feature/`. The complete specification-to-code journey is documented in the **SDD Journey** document (`docs/journey-{feature}.md`) with phase timestamps, gate decisions, and traceability metrics.

### Quality Gates

- **Phase Validation** — every tool validates it's being called in the correct pipeline phase
- **Gate Enforcement** — `advancePhase()` blocks if gate decision is BLOCK or CHANGES_NEEDED
- **EARS Validator** — programmatic requirement quality enforcement
- **Cross-Artifact Analysis** — automatic alignment checking between spec, design, and tasks
- **Phase Enforcement** — state machine blocks phase-skipping; required files gate advancement
- **507 unit tests** — CI enforces thresholds on every push
