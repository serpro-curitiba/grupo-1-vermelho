name: Pipeline Orchestrator
description: "This skill should be used when the user asks to 'orchestrate pipeline', 'run full pipeline', 'coordinate phases', 'advance phase', or needs guidance on end-to-end pipeline execution. Also trigger on 'specky orchestrate', 'phase transition', 'LGTM gate', 'pipeline status', or 'which agent for this phase'."

# Pipeline Orchestrator

## Overview

The orchestrator coordinates the full 10-phase SDD pipeline, routing to the correct agent per phase, validating artifacts between transitions, and enforcing LGTM gates.

## Agent Routing Table

### Post-Phase Hooks (validate after tool runs)

| Tool Matcher | Hooks | Type |
|-------------|-------|------|
| sdd_init | phase-gate, auto-checkpoint | Blocking + Advisory |
| sdd_write_spec, sdd_turnkey_spec | phase-gate, spec-quality, ears-validator, lgtm-gate, spec-sync, auto-checkpoint | Mixed |

| sdd_run_analysis, sdd_cross_analyze | phase-gate, cognitive-debt-alert, metrics-dashboard, drift-monitor | Mixed |

## LGTM Gate Protocol

Phases 2 (Specify), 4 (Design), and 5 (Tasks) require human LGTM before advancing:

1. Phase agent completes and writes artifact
2. lgtm-gate.sh runs → prints artifact summary
3. Orchestrator asks: "Review [ARTIFACT]. Reply 'LGTM' to proceed."
4. If LGTM → call sdd_advance_phase → next agent
5. If feedback → route back to phase agent for revision
6. Loop until LGTM received

## Branch Validation per Phase

| Phase | Expected Branch | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| 0 (Init) | develop | Create spec/NNN-* from develop |
| 1-7 | spec/NNN-* | All spec work on feature branch |
| 8 (Verify) | develop | After merge from spec branch |
| 9 (Release) | stage | After merge from develop |
| Production | main | After PR merge from stage |

## Phase Transition Checklist

Before calling sdd_advance_phase, verify:
1. ✅ Required artifact exists (PHASE_REQUIRED_FILES)
2. ✅ Artifact has minimum quality (phase-gate.sh passed)
3. ✅ LGTM received (if phase 2, 4, or 5)
4. ✅ Branch matches expectations
5. ✅ Checkpoint created (sdd_checkpoint)
6. ✅ No blocking hook failures
