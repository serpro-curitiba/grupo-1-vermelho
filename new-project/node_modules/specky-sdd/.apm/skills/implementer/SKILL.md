# Implementation Orchestrator (Phase 7)

## Overview

Phase 7 transforms specification and design artifacts into a structured implementation plan with code scaffolding, infrastructure definitions, and quality assurance frameworks.

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting implementation, verify:
- You are on the correct `spec/NNN-*` branch (not develop, stage, or main)
- SPECIFICATION.md is complete with EARS notation requirements
- DESIGN.md includes architecture, API contracts, and data schema
- TASKS.md has work breakdown structure with dependencies
- All stakeholders have approved DESIGN.md
- Technical team has reviewed and confirmed feasibility
- Infrastructure resources are allocated and accessible

Run `/specky:check-phase-5` to validate prerequisites.

## Implementation Plan Generation

Generate a phased implementation plan with four distinct stages:

### Foundation Stage
Set up project skeleton, CI/CD pipelines, database migrations, and authentication framework. Duration typically 15-20% of total effort. Outputs:
- Empty project structure matching DESIGN.md architecture
- Docker/container definitions for local and production
- Database migration system initialized
- GitHub Actions/CI configuration from DESIGN.md

### Core Stage
Implement core business logic per TASKS.md sequencing. Focus on entities, APIs, and critical paths. Duration 40-50% of effort. Outputs:
- Data models and ORM definitions
- REST/GraphQL APIs matching DESIGN.md contracts
- Business logic implementation
- Unit test stubs for all modules

### Integration Stage
Connect subsystems, external APIs, and third-party services. Duration 20-25% of effort. Outputs:
- Third-party integrations (payment, auth, analytics)
- Message queue/event system setup
- Cross-module integration tests
- API gateway configuration

### Polish Stage
Performance optimization, error handling, logging, and observability. Duration 10-15% of effort. Outputs:
- Caching strategy implementation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging framework
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Quality Checklist Generation

Generate domain-specific quality checklists from SPECIFICATION.md:

**Security Domain:**
- OWASP Top 10 items applicable to architecture
- Data encryption requirements (in-transit, at-rest)
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Input validation and sanitization rules
- Audit logging and compliance tracking

**Testing Domain:**
- Unit test coverage targets (default 80% minimum)
- Integration test scenarios per SPECIFICATION.md
- End-to-end test paths for critical user flows
- Performance benchmarks from DESIGN.md NFRs
- Security test cases (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)

**Conditional NFRs:**
If SPECIFICATION.md includes scalability requirements:
- Load testing strategy with target RPS
- Database query optimization checklist
- Caching strategy validation
- Horizontal scaling test scenarios

If high availability required:
- Failover test procedures
- Data consistency verification
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) validation
- Backup and restore procedures

## Test Framework Auto-Detection

Analyze technology stack from DESIGN.md and recommend test frameworks:

**Python projects** → pytest + pytest-cov
**Node.js projects** → Jest + Vitest for unit, Playwright for E2E
**Go projects** → testing package + testify
**Java projects** → JUnit 5 + Mockito + TestContainers
**C#/.NET projects** → xUnit + Moq + SpecFlow
**Rust projects** → built-in testing + proptest

Generate starter test configuration files and example test templates.

## Infrastructure Decision Tree

From DESIGN.md deployment topology, auto-generate infrastructure choices:

1. **Container Runtime** — Docker recommended; Podman alternative
2. **Orchestration** — Kubernetes if multi-replica; Docker Compose if single-node dev
3. **Database** — SQL (PostgreSQL) vs NoSQL per DESIGN.md data schema
4. **Caching Layer** — Redis for session/cache, memcached alternative
5. **Message Queue** — RabbitMQ/Kafka per event volume in SPECIFICATION.md
6. **Monitoring** — Prometheus + Grafana stack
7. **Log Aggregation** — ELK (Elasticsearch) or Loki

Generate Terraform/CloudFormation/Helm templates matching selections.

## Spec-Sync During Implementation

Continuous synchronization between SPECIFICATION.md and implementation:

- When code deviates from SPECIFICATION.md, flag as spec drift
- When implementation discovers missing requirement, update SPECIFICATION.md
- If design changes needed mid-implementation, update DESIGN.md and notify stakeholders
- Daily spec-sync report comparing implemented features to SPECIFICATION.md

## Implementation Handoff Template

When Phase 7 completes, provide handoff document including:

```
## Implementation Status
- Artifacts generated: [list]
- Scaffolding complete: [yes/no]
- Quality checklist items: [count]
- Framework selections validated: [yes/no]
- Infrastructure templates generated: [yes/no]

## Next Phase Entry Criteria
All Phase 7 outputs ready for Phase 8 (Verify):
- Code compiles without errors
- All test stubs created
- CI/CD pipeline functional
- Infrastructure definitions validated

## Known Gaps
- [List of incomplete items, if any]
- Estimated effort to complete: [hours]

## Recommendations
- [Technical notes for implementation team]
```

Reference: **arXiv:2502.08235** — Use standard inference (no extended thinking) for Phase 7 scaffolding to optimize quality-cost tradeoff. Extended thinking adds 43% cost with 30% quality reduction in code generation.
